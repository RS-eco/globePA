### Appendix S3: Additional and extended results

![](figures/ter_sum_add_var.png)

**Figure S6.** Percentage of area protected, separately for different IUCN categories, for different additional climatic conditions for the terrestrial realm, with (a) temperature seasonality, (b) temperature annual range and (c) precipitation seasonality. In order to calculate the percentage of area protected, the different biophysical conditions were divided into bins observed with equal frequency. The optimal number of bins (N <= 100) was derived iteratively for each variable ((a), (b), (c) N = 100). Black lines indicate the expected percentage of area protected given that all conditions are evenly protected. For some variables this line is not flat, as the underlying data is strongly skewed and so no bins observed with absolute equal frequency could be calculated. Note that the individual bins of each variable represent percentile ranges and so cover a different extent, which is also reflected in the irregular intervals of the x-axis.

**Figure S7.** Percentage of terrestrial area protected for each IUCN category (I-II, III-IV, V-VI and Not-designated) and each biophysical variable (Annual mean temperature (°C), temperature seasonality, temperature annual range, annual precipitation (mm), precipitation seasonality and elevation) separately. In order to calculate the percentage of area protected, the different biophysical conditions were divided into bins observed with equal frequency. The optimal number of bins (N <= 100) was derived iteratively for each variable. Black lines indicate the expected percentage of area protected given that all conditions are evenly protected across all IUCN categories. For some variables this line is not flat, as the underlying data is strongly skewed and so no bins observed with absolute equal frequency could be calculated. Note that the individual bins of each variable represent percentile ranges and so cover a different extent, which is also reflected in the irregular intervals of the x-axis.

**Figure S8.** Percentage of area protected, separately for different IUCN categories, for different additional climatic conditions for the marine realm, with (a) annual range in SST, (b) annual variance in SST, (c) annual range in SSS and (d) annual variance in SSS. In order to calculate the percentage of area protected, the different biophysical conditions were divided into bins observed with equal frequency. The optimal number of bins (N <= 100) was derived iteratively for each variable ((a) N = 97, (b) N = 98, (c) N = 69, (d) N = 81). Black lines indicate the expected percentage of area protected given that all conditions are evenly protected. For some variables this line is not flat, as the underlying data is strongly skewed and so no bins observed with absolute equal frequency could be calculated. Note that the individual bins of each variable represent percentile ranges and so cover a different extent, which is also reflected in the irregular intervals of the x-axis.

In order to calculate the percentage of area protected, the different biophysical conditions were divided into bins observed with equal frequency. The optimal number of bins (N <= 100) was derived iteratively for each variable. Black lines indicate the expected percentage of area protected given that all conditions are evenly protected across all IUCN categories. For some variables this line is not flat, as the underlying data is strongly skewed and so no bins observed with absolute equal frequency could be calculated. Note that the individual bins of each variable represent percentile ranges and so cover a different extent, which is also reflected in the irregular intervals of the x-axis.

**Figure S10.** Area of each zoogeographic realm and the percentage protected by each biophysical condition ((a) temperature, (b) precipitation and (c) elevation) and their pairwise combinations ((d) temperature and precipitation, (e) temperature and elevation, (f) precipitation and elevation). The percentage protected´ was calculated considering all protection categories (I-II, III-IV, V-VI and non-designated) together. Given that the percentage protected is not-normally distributed, the color legend is divided into 12 intervals reflecting a log10-transformed continuous scale.

**Figure S12.** Percentage of area protected, separately for different IUCN categories, for different biophysical conditions in the terrestrial (a, b, c) and marine (d, e, f) realm. In order to calculate the percentage of area protected, the different biophysical conditions were divided into equally-spaced bins (1° for temperature and sea surface temperature, 100 mm for precipitation, 1 psu for salinity and 100 m for elevation and bathymetry). Black lines indicate the area that is covered globally by each of the different bins (y-axis on the right-hand side). Note that the scales of both y-axes are square-root transformed.

Pixels are based on the equally-spaced bins shown in Figure S12. Bar charts indicate the total area that is covered by certain levels of protection. The percentage area protected was calculated considering all protection categories (I-II, III-IV, V-VI and non-designated) together.

The percentage area protected is based on the equally-spaced bins (1°/100mm/100m) shown in Figure S12, S13 and was calculated considering all protection categories (I-II, III-IV, V-VI and non-designated) together. Given that the percentage area protected is not-normally distributed, the color legend is divided into 12 intervals reflecting a log10-transformed continuous scale. Maps are in Mollweide projection (ESRI:54009).

The percentage area protected is based on the equally-spaced bins (1°/1psu/100m) shown in Figure S12, S13 and was calculated considering all protection categories (I-II, III-IV, V-VI and non-designated) together. Given that the percentage area protected is not-normally distributed, the color legend is divided into 12 intervals reflecting a log10-transformed continuous scale. Maps are in Mollweide projection (ESRI:54009).
